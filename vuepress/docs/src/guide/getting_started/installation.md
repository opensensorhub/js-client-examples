### Github
[![github](https://img.shields.io/github/release/opensensorhub/osh-js.svg?style=flat-square&maxAge=600)](https://github.com/opensensorhub/osh-js/releases/latest)

You can download the latest version of [osh-js on GitHub](https://github.com/opensensorhub/osh-js/releases/latest).

If you download or clone the repository, you must [build](../advanced/developers/contributing) osh-js.js to generate the dist files. osh-js no longer comes with prebuilt release versions, so an alternative option to downloading the repo is **strongly** advised.
